Here's a summary of the key themes, urgent cases, and overall sentiment from today's Reddit immigration posts:

**1. Key Immigration-Related Topics and Trends:**

*   **Processing Delays:** A major theme is the anxiety surrounding USCIS processing times across various applications (I-485, I-130, N-400, I-730), particularly at specific field offices like Raleigh Durham and St. Louis for oath ceremonies. People are sharing timelines, asking for comparative experiences, and expressing frustration.
*   **RFEs and Denials:** Several posts deal with Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and denials, including perceived improper denials of I-290B motions, and an extensive RFE for an O1 visa despite seemingly strong evidence. This highlights concerns about inconsistent adjudication and the stress of responding to USCIS requests.
*   **Advance Parole & Port of Entry Experiences:** There's a post about a secondary inspection at LAX on Advance Parole, indicating potential scrutiny even with valid travel documents.
*   **H1B Visa Concerns:** Inquiries about side consulting while on an H1B, changes in job titles affecting H1B stamping, and overall PERM processing are present.
*   **OPT/F1 Visa Issues:** Questions about OPT RFE requirements, SSN acquisition after OPT approval, opening savings accounts as an F1 student, and OPT premium processing timelines.
*   **N-400 Naturalization:** Delays in Oath Ceremonies for naturalization from the N400 application, updating the SSN during N400 application, and general timeline questions for N-400 processing.
*   **Moral Concerns/Hardship Cases**: A user lamented the passing of a loved one and their ineligibility to travel because they didn't file for travel documents. A user files an expedite request due to a massive earthquake and family loss, but the request may have been denied.

**2. Panic or Urgent Cases:**

*   **Deportation of US Citizen Children:** The report of ICE deporting US citizen children with cancer in New Orleans is a major point of concern and outrage, representing a significant crisis.
*   **Improper I-290B Denial:** A marriage-based AOS petition was denied after the RFE response was confirmed delivered, and the subsequent appeal was also denied improperly. The user is seeking advice on what to do.
*   **Overstaying Visa Waiver Program:** A person overstaying their VWP is extremely anxious about potential detention and increased enforcement at airports, seeking advice on minimizing risks.
*   **I-140 procedural mistake:** An approved I-140 was sent to the NVC by mistake, which may delay the I-485 application.

**3. General Emotional Tone/Sentiment:**

*   **Anxious and Frustrated:** A prevailing sense of anxiety and frustration is evident, primarily stemming from processing delays, uncertainty, and fears of denials or policy changes.
*   **Hopeful but Weary:** Some express hope while also acknowledging the long and arduous nature of the immigration process.
*   **Outrage and Fear:** The deportation case is causing anger and fear regarding ICE's actions.
*   **Seeking Guidance and Support:** Many users are actively seeking advice and sharing experiences, creating a sense of community and mutual support.
