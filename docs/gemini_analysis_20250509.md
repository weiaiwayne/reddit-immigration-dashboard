Here's a breakdown of the Reddit posts, summarizing key trends, urgent cases, and overall sentiment:

**1. Key Immigration-Related Topics and Trends:**

*   **Delays and Processing Times:** Overwhelming concern and frustration regarding processing times for OPT, I-130, I-485, N-400, and I-751 applications. Specifically, there's anxiety about Newark, Chicago FO, and Guatemala I-130 processing times. People are sharing timelines and seeking benchmarks.
*   **Adjustment of Status (AOS) Concerns:** Multiple posts related to marriage-based AOS, including concerns about "too soon" marriages, evidence of bona fide marriage, and the impact of past visa denials or revoked green cards. There are also questions about filing AOS while on F1 visa and potential risks of misuse.
*   **H1B Visa Issues:** H1B transfer timelines, delays, I-9 verification questions, and concerns about extension applications are prominent. People are seeking advice about I-9 forms and the timing of notifying HR about a green card.
*   **F1 Visa/OPT Issues:** SEVIS transfer problems, OPT delays causing visa expiration concerns, and experiences of enhanced scrutiny upon reentry to the US on STEM OPT. People are questioning the safety of hybrid programs and their effects on F1 visa holders.
*   **Naturalization (N-400) Concerns:** Questions about evidence, the impact of name changes, interview rescheduling due to illness, and delays in oath ceremony scheduling.
*   **Travel and Re-entry Risks:** Concerns about re-entering the US with a green card after visiting China, traveling with a travel document while AOS is pending, and border proximity concerns.
*    **USCIS SAVE verification for driver's licenses renewal** Confusion regarding H1B status not being reflected

**2. Panic or Urgent Cases:**

*   **F1 SEVIS Transfer Mishap:** A person worked two weeks *after* their SEVIS record was transferred, potentially violating their visa status. This creates a serious compliance issue.
*   **OPT Delay with Visa Expiration:** An individual's OPT application is taking 7 months, while their visa expires soon, putting their ability to remain in the US in immediate jeopardy.
*   **I-751 Denial and Potential Detention:** Someone with a revoked green card due to an I-751 denial (lack of merit) is now facing an AOS interview based on a second marriage and is worried about detention.
*   **Potential Visa Denial Due to Past History:** Person worried about being denied entry to US on tourist visa due to past denial.
*   **Grandmother on death bed needs citizenship.** Someone needs to urgently get citizenship and can not get the oath ceremony.

**3. General Emotional Tone/Sentiment:**

*   **Anxious and Uncertain:** Overwhelmingly, the dominant sentiment is anxiety. People are worried about application outcomes, potential visa violations, travel risks, and long processing times.
*   **Hopeful but Cautious:** Some express hopefulness about their cases, especially after positive interview experiences, but remain cautious until final approval. The "Approved! - with Interview" post is a bright spot, but even there, past stress is evident.
*   **Frustrated and Confused:** Many express frustration with USCIS processing times and a lack of clear communication, with people often turning to Reddit for information their lawyers seemingly can't provide. The DMV experiences for license renewal highlight systemic inefficiencies.
*   **Gratitude and Relief:** Individuals who have recently received approvals express gratitude and share their timelines to offer hope to others in similar situations.
