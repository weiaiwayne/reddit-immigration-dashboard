Okay, here's a summary of the key immigration-related discussions, urgent issues, and overall sentiment gleaned from today's Reddit posts:

**1. Key Immigration Topics and Trends:**

*   **Employment-Based Visas (H1B, L1, O1, E3):** This is a very prominent theme. Concerns exist regarding lottery selection, transfers, layoffs, approvals, remote work policies, and potential H1B visa revocations mirroring recent F1 issues. STEM OPT and transitioning from OPT to other visas are common topics.
*   **Family-Based Immigration (I-130, I-485):** Many posts revolve around family-based green card applications, particularly through marriage. Issues include interview experiences, required evidence, financial support (I-864), and concerns about USCIS scrutinizing genuine marriages.
*   **Adjustment of Status (AOS) Difficulties:** Many are sharing timelines, asking about API queries, NOIDs, RFEs, and dealing with delays in I-485 processing. Concerns regarding USCIS processing times, potential denials, and impact on employment authorization (EAD) are prominent.
*   **Travel Concerns:** Green card holders, those with Advance Parole (I-131), and visa holders express anxiety about traveling in the current climate due to increased border scrutiny, potential delays, and potential entry denials.
*   **Visas & Consular Processing (K1, CR1, B1/B2, F1):** K1 visa interview preparation, scheduling challenges, and visa rejections are discussed. F1 visa holders are anxious about the political climate and potential revocations. B visitor visas and applying for these visas is also a concern.
*   **Naturalization (N-400):** Questions about eligibility, required documentation, and interview experiences are being asked. Concerns about meeting residency requirements and prior issues are discussed.
*   **Deportation and Enforcement Fears:** Posts reflect widespread anxiety about increased ICE activity, parole terminations, and the potential for deportation, even for legal immigrants.
*   **Financial Burdens:** The costs associated with immigration processes (legal fees, application fees) are a significant concern.
*   **TPS and Asylum:** Discussed mainly are impacts on the parole and status of those under TPS or with pending asylum applications.
*   **Ethical Dilemmas:** Potential marriage fraud and seeking jobs offering VISA sponsorship.

**2. Panic/Urgent Cases:**

*   **Parole Terminations:** Several posts describe sudden parole terminations (particularly for those who entered via CBP One) with imminent deadlines to leave the US. This is causing extreme distress.
*   **I-485 Denials and Work Permit Revocation:** A case of I-485 denial due to I-864 issues, with a very short window to prevent EAD revocation, exemplifies an urgent crisis.
*   **Unexpected Denial of N-400:** An individual with a long history in the US and a marriage-based green card facing N-400 denial is in a state of distress.
*   **Losing Status Due to Layoffs:** Individuals on H1B and L1 visas who are laid off are scrambling to find new jobs to maintain their status. There is also frustration regarding lengthy approval processes.
*   **Concerns About Prior Criminal History:** Green card holders and those applying for AOS are concerned about past criminal records and their impact on their cases.
*   **Potential Deportation and CBP Encounters:** Received notice of termination of parole in error as US citizen and those seeking advice to avoid negative CBP interactions.
*    **Expired Green Card w/ pending ROC/NR**: Concerns over ability to travel.

**3. General Emotional Tone/Sentiment:**

*   **Anxiety and Fear:** Overarching sentiment is high anxiety related to the changing political climate, increased enforcement, and potential for deportation. Fear of making mistakes in applications is also prevalent.
*   **Frustration and Stress:** Delays in processing, RFEs, and perceived inconsistencies in USCIS decisions cause significant frustration.
*   **Desperation:** Some posts convey a sense of desperation to find employment or legal avenues to remain in the US.
*   **Resignation:** Some posts show a resignation to the difficulties of the immigration process.
*   **Hope and Gratitude:** Approvals of EADs, green cards, and naturalization applications are celebrated, providing glimmers of hope. There's gratitude expressed to those who help within the subreddit community.
*    **Regret:** Some express regret about certain life and legal decisions.

*    **General negative view of the US administration.**
